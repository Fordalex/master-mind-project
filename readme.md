# Master Mind Project

Mastermind is a vintage family game from my childhood. It is a game that requires a player to use logic, speculation and reasoning skills to determine the sequence of colored pegs. The computer has secretly generated a sequence leaving players having 10 attempts to guess correctly, or the computer wins!

## UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

Choosing Colours - The user is able to select the colours of the pegs and put them in order on the virtual board to allow the user to guess the computers coloured pegs, and remove them if a mistake is made.

After a while the game doesn't seem to have a reason to keep playing, you can choose between two themes if you get bored. But the user doesn't get anything for doing better than the last round, I am implementing a feature where the player will receive coins. The faster you solve the masters counters and the few guesses it takes you, the more coins you will get. The coins will be used to buy different counters, if you lose the computer will take some coins back off you!

### Features Left to Implement

At the end of the game, if the user wins I would like counters to be generated on the board in a moving pattern and a happy sound to be played, to give positive feed back to the user. If the player loses, all the pegs to turn red and be static, with a bad sound being played.

Also more categorys for items to be purchased keeping the user intrested for a longer time.
